 Arduino-based technology to monitor soil moisture levels in real-time then can transmit the readings to my PC (up to 2,000,000 times per second). When the soil is dehydrated, the system automatically activates a water pump to irrigate the plant, then stops when optimal moisture is reached. Input code in Arduino IDE. Components required: Arduino UNO r3, HW 080, 2x aa battery holder with batteries (ofc), L289N Motor controller, 3-5v water pump
